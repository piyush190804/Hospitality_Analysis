## 🏢 𝗖𝗢𝗠𝗣𝗔𝗡𝗬 𝗕𝗔𝗖𝗞𝗚𝗥𝗢𝗨𝗡𝗗
AtliQ Grands is a reputed luxury hotel chain operating across major Indian cities for the past two decades. Facing competitive pressures and internal inefficiencies, the company began losing market share and profitability.

To counter this, the management decided to adopt Business & Data Intelligence by outsourcing data analysis to uncover deep insights and improve decision-making.
## ❓𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗕𝗟𝗘𝗠 𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗧𝗘𝗠𝗘𝗡𝗧
Despite having vast historical data, AtliQ Grands lacked the in-house capabilities to analyze it. As a result:

- 📉 Revenue fell due to outdated decision-making.

- 📊 Booking trends were unclear.

- 📌 Operational inefficiencies were hard to identify.

Hence, a third-party analyst (you!) was brought in to transform the raw data into powerful dashboards and insights.

## 🎯 𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗝𝗘𝗖𝗧 𝗢𝗕𝗝𝗘𝗖𝗧𝗜𝗩𝗘𝗦

- ✅ Design a multi-page interactive dashboard (Executive, Revenue, Booking, and Performance views)
- ✅ Extract actionable KPIs to support strategic planning
- ✅ Help regain market share through visual analytics and insights
- ✅ Go beyond mockups to find hidden trends and value drivers
